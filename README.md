# Instacart-Market-Basket-Analysis
The goal of this project is to analyze 3 million grocery orders from over 200,000 Instacart users and predict which previously purchased items are likely to appear in a user's next order. Customer segmentation and affinity analysis are conducted to understand purchasing patterns and enhance product marketing and cross-selling strategies.
